# Skin Cancer Lesion Detection Using Deep Learning

This project was developed as part of my final year dissertation at university. The objective was to explore how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) could be applied to detect and classify skin cancer lesions using dermoscopic image data.

## Project Overview

The project involved:
- Conducting a literature review on AI-based skin lesion classification
- Sourcing and preprocessing dermoscopic image datasets
- Building and training CNN models in Google Colab
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Although this was a research-focused project, it demonstrates the practical application of AI in the healthcare domain.

## Results

- Trained CNN models were able to distinguish between different lesion types
- Achieved 78% accuracy on validation data
- Model performance visualised using training curves and confusion matrices

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- OpenCV
